      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Miracle Anih, a passionate web development Student. I love creating clean, functional web pages using HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>I recently started a Front-End Development bootcamp with GirlLEAD, and the experience has been nothing short of beautiful. It's deepening my understanding of front end terms and boosting my confidence in building real-world projects.</p>
      <p>I'm currently focused on responsive design, accessibility, and mastering HT,M and CSS.I enjoy solving problems creatively and writing clean, efficient code.</p>
      <p>My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer who builds meaningful digital experiences and to inspire others who are beginning their journey into tech, just like I once did.</p>

      <h2>Latest Blog Post</h2>
      <p>Recently, I started working on a project more like building a responsive portfolio website using semantic HTML and CSS.<br> It is really helping me understand the importance of clean structure and accessibility on the web.</p>
      <p>In addition to HTML and CSS, I’ve been diving into Flexbox and CSS Grid to enhance the layout structure, making it more flexible and adaptive to different screen sizes. I’m also focusing on building for accessibility, ensuring that the site works well for users with different needs.</p>

      <p>This project has taught me so much about semantic HTML,  and using best practices for creating modern websites. It’s amazing to see how small changes can have such a big impact on the layout and user experience.</p>
    
      <p>Another challenge I’ve enjoyed tackling is adding hover effects and ensuring smooth transitions when interacting with elements like buttons and links. I believe these little details really enhance the user experience and make a website feel polished.</p>
    
      <p>As I continue to improve my skills in front-end development, I’m eager to learn  about JavaScript and how I can add interactive features to my projects. I hope to incorporate dynamic content like forms and animations soon.</p>
    
      <p>Stay tuned as I keep sharing my progress and insights from this journey</p> </article>
